**isab4147/isab4147** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 👩‍💻 I’m currently working on some [Haskell stuff](https://github.com/isab4147/haskell-euler) and also in an [WhatsApp bot](thatsobviouslyprivate) for a [startup](https://datamachina.com.br/).
- 🔧 I’m currently learning Haskell, obviously! But I'm also an undergrad student at [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br).
- 😋👌 I really like Linux 🐧 & coffee ☕.
